## Global vaccine tracker 
For the Global Vaccine Tracker Tableau project, I worked on creating a data visualization that would provide insights into the global distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. The project aimed to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world data, design effective and informative visualizations, and communicate insights effectively to a broad audience.

The project was developed using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, and it included the following steps:

- Data cleaning, pre-processing, and preparation, to ensure the data was in a format suitable for analysis.
- Data visualization, involving the creation of interactive dashboards and charts that effectively communicated the data and insights.
- Insights and recommendations, generated based on the data analysis, to help policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the general public understand the global distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.

The project aimed to provide a real-time and interactive solution for tracking the global distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines, and to help inform decisions and strategies related to the pandemic response.
